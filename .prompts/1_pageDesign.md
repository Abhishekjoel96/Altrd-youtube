<issue>
Current page designs waste a lot of vertical space. 
</issue>
<modifications>
- make the navbar vertical like file explorer in vs code, a side pane
- YouTube Clipper tab: 
    - load video form is too wide - one line search and load 
    - make it 2 column layout that fits in screen 
    - left, loading video, middle - video display from yt, below it the slider and time stamp 
    - save clip that shows: start end, duration, Save button 

- My Clips Tab: 
 - call it editor tab
 - Two screen design
 - first screen: [correct] shows captions and clip next to it with aspect ratio setting in two cols
 - second screen: 
    - first half, positioning settings 
    - second half, caption text coloring and other settings 
    - one nice "Generate" button 
- Clip editing is not intuitive, it shows editor for all clips
- show clips section first, when we click the clip [a card showing the video that we saved earlier] the editor should update, make this collabsible 

- save clips
    - this looks fine
    - just match the design language

<overall>
- The page was AI generated and lacks clear UI UX flow with a lack of understanding of what needs to be done
